1. large object
2. test ssim first
3. 

observations:
converge too fast -> overfitting
sudden change

structure component from ssim
extract contour
normalize with contour area

1. change of the object
2. brightness matters not, the contour matters


observe the good-quality image first:
1. elephant
2. UT student
3. Lion
